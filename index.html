            What would I put in a bio at this point in my life?
            What do I identify with these days??
            Dancing? Yoga, of course.
            Cats? Hiking? Plants.
            I enjoy movement arts. I enjoy many styles of dance, most recently I have been taking adult ballet classes.
            I enjoy long hikes and road trips. I like learning about plants. I have some cacti that have grown from seeds.
