Introduction 

The purpose of this assignment is to build a basic webpage to introduce myself to my teacher and classmates. This will be created using basic HTML and CSS concepts.

The Page should be well-formed and valid using HTML5 and should include:
 

    Your name (<h1>)
    A picture (<img>)
    Titled Sections (<h2>)
    A biography (<p>)
    Interests (unordered list (<ul> <li>)
    Favorite websites  (ordered list of anchor tags that link correctly (<ol><li>)


I have taken HTML classes in the past but this is the first one taken for college credit. A template was provided for this assignment, but I did not use it because I wanted to challenge myself and see how far I could get without it. While I completed most of the content, I still require the head of the template since it includes the lines that will link the css and image files.
